Refresh Purchase Details Table in Production

This script safely truncates and repopulates the `purchase_details` table
from the data in the `invoices`, `invoice_items`, and `invoice_metadata` tables.
It is designed to be run on the production database to ensure the export
table is always up-to-date.
